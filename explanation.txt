in this project we have used the natural language tool kit(nltk) to do a series of analysis on the inaugural speech of the us presidents 
working:
1.First the user has to input the year of speech he/she has to analyse
2.the system will take that speech from the inaugural speech corpus and do certain pre processing steps on it such as tokenization using Punktsentence tokenizer
3.then the system uses the pos_tag library of nltk to tag the part of speech with each word
4.then using the result of the above process we find the number of nouns adverbs and verbs from the tagged list and print them
5.then we find the important terms from the selected speech and make tree out of it using .draw() function
